SLang (SonarSource Language) is a framework to quickly develop code analyzers for SonarQube to help developers write projects with integrated code quality and security.

SLang defines language-agnostic AST. Using this AST we can develop simple syntax-based rules. Then we use a parser for real language to create this AST.

## Have questions or feedback?

To provide feedback (request a feature, report a bug, etc.) use the [SonarQube Community Forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/). Please do not forget to specify the language, plugin version, and SonarQube version.

## Building

### Setup

Install Java 17.

### Build
Build and run Unit Tests:

    ./gradlew build


## License headers

License headers are automatically updated by the spotless plugin but only for Java files. 
Furthermore, there are files such as `package-info.java` and `module-info.java` that spotless ignores. For those files use a manual script like below to update the license. E.g. on Mac:

    `find . -type f -name "*-info.java" -exec sed -i '' 's/2018-2024/2018-2025/' "{}" \;`
