<p>Having two <code>cases</code> in a <code>when</code> statement or two branches in an <code>if</code> chain with the same implementation is at
best duplicate code, and at worst a coding error. If the same logic is truly needed for both instances, then in an <code>if</code> chain they should
be combined, or for a <code>when</code>, one should fall through to the other. </p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Blocks in an <code>if</code> chain that contain a single line of code are ignored, as are blocks in a <code>when</code> statement that contain a
single line of code with or without a following <code>break</code>.</p>
<p>But this exception does not apply to <code>if</code> chains without <code>else</code>-s, or to <code>when</code>-es without default clauses when
all branches have the same single line of code. In case of <code>if</code> chains with <code>else</code>-s, or of <code>when</code>-es with default
clauses, rule {rule:kotlin:S3923} raises a bug. </p>
